== Animal information ==
* '''DOB''': 2015-09-16
* '''Strain''': C57BL/6J
* '''Experimenter''': Billy
* '''Study''': Tetrode recordings from auditory striatum during psychometric curve and reward change task

== Procedures ==
* 2016-02-12: Billy implanted 8 tetrodes coated in DiI to target right auditory striatum.
** A-P: -1.7mm from Bregma
** M-L: 3.55mm right
** D-V: -2.0mm from brain surface on day of surgery
* 2016-05-10: Euthanized and perfused.

== Skull measurements ==
From Bregma (where sutures meet) to Lambda:
* X: 0.00mm left
* Y: -4.05mm back
* Z: 0.00mm down

From where Bregma lines meet to where they would have met: 0.09mm up

From where Lambda lines meet to where they would have met: 0mm

Notes: Bregma lines come in and dip low before meeting together. Point where lines met midline was used as origin for measurements. Point where they would have met was used (not where they actually met) in making craniotomies.

Z coordinate at sight of craniotomy:
* Left side: -0.61mm
* Right side: -0.57mm

== Details ==

=== Purpose ===
This animal was trained and implanted on the right side auditory striatum. The purpose was collect data from an awake, behaving mouse. We analyzed data from the animal doing the psychometric curve and reward change task.

=== Superglue as first layer ===
As with the last few animals, superglue was used as a first layer on the skull. This has proven to be very successful.

=== Electrolytic Lesions ===
Before, euthanizing this animal, electrolytic lesions were made. The polarity was switched so that the ground of the 12V DC source was touching the gold pins in the implant and the power was in the mouth of the mouse. The ground was just touched to the gold pins very quickly. The animal was still seen to jump. See electrolytic lesion section below to see lesion images.

=== Skull screws to hold implant ===
Three screws of size #000-120 were put into the skull. Two screws were in the front (anterior) of the skull in front of bregma (one on each side of bregma) and one on the opposite side of the implant. The holes were made first by hand drill using a 0.028" diameter drill bit. Drilling the holes caused a little bit of blood to come out. The screws were later covered with dental acrylic to securely attach the implant to the skull.

=== Tetrode DiI coating ===
The tetrodes were coated with DiI so that when the brain slices are imaged, where the tetrodes were inserted could clearly be seen. These can be seen in the images labelled overlay in the brain slice images. They are useful in determining whether the target was reached and if the coordinates to get to the auditory striatum were correct or not.

=== Ground wire ===
Stainless steel (0.005" bare, 0.008" coated, annealed) was used for ground wire. A 1mm hook was made and placed under the skull after a small craniotomy. The ground wire craniotomy was made on the same side of the midline from where the implant is.

=== Sound Response ===
Sound response and frequency tuning was found in this mouse. The tetrodes seem to be in the striatum and moved all the way through.

== Tetrode Lengths ==
The tetrodes were cut at an angle so that not all were the same length. The longest tetrode was inserted 2mm into the brain. The lengths listed below are lengths from the longest tetrode. (These are according to the names of the tetrodes on open-ephys NOT the EIB)
* TT2: 0um
* TT1: 50um
* TT5: 140um
* TT4: 190um
* TT7: 310um
* TT6: 410um
* TT8: 430um
* TT3: 600um


The tetrode impedances seemed to be in the normal range of 100-400kOhms when tested except:
* TT2 #2: 79.1kOhms
* TT2 #4: 79.3kOhms
* TT3 #2: 504kOhms

== Tetrode advance ==
* starting depth of tetrodes in brain: 2.0 mm from surface
* 1 turn is 317 micrometers
* For screw positions, up (^) is the anterior of the brain

=== Training Results ===

Adap017 was doing the psychometric curve and reward change task. He was doing it fairly well. However, the reward change with a shifting psychometric curve was run a few times when he was first beginning the reward change task but the psychometric curve did not shift. This implies that adap017 was not biased with difference in reward size, at least for the first few recordings of the reward change task.

== Accuracy of implant==

Distance to the farthest posterior end of the right auditory striatum: 400um 

These images show red DiI where the the end of the tetrodes were and therefore one can estimate how accurate the coordinates for the craniotomy to get to the auditory striatum were. The tetrodes were coated with DiI before being inserted into the brain. The images shown were taken as an overlay to show the DiI and where the tetrodes were in the brain. For this mouse, the tetrodes were inserted 2.0mm deep then moved down. The tetrodes seem to be approximately 400um too anterior to the farthest point posterior to the end of the auditory striatum. The tetrodes were too medial but went in at an angle so hit the striatum. The depth of the tetrodes at the time of lesioning was too deep. The tetrodes found auditory response and frequency tuning in this location.

== Electrolytic Lesion ==

Only 2 tetrodes were used to make electrolytic lesions in the brain. Tetrodes 2 and 3 were used since they were the shortest and longest length tetrodes. Two lesions may have burned too much tissue. I believe the large holes seen in the images are due to the lesioning. Therefore, maybe touching the pins less when lesioning may work. Touch the pins less than 10 times.
