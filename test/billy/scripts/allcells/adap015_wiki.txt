== Animal information ==
* '''DOB''': 2015-03-24
* '''Strain''': C57BL/6J
* '''Experimenter''': Billy
* '''Study''': Tetrode recordings from auditory striatum during psychometric curve task
* '''Weight at time of implant''': 32.0g

== Procedures ==
* 2016-01-14: Billy implanted 8 tetrodes coated in DiI to target right auditory striatum.
** A-P: -1.7mm from Bregma
** M-L: 3.5mm right
** D-V: -2.0mm from brain surface on day of surgery
* 2016-03-28: Euthanized and perfused.

== Skull measurements ==
From Bregma (where sutures meet) to Lambda:
* X: 0.04mm left
* Y: -3.70mm back
* Z: -0.04mm down

From where Bregma lines meet to where they would have met: 0.05mm up 

From where Lambda lines meet to where they would have met: 0mm

Notes: Bregma lines come in and dip low before meeting together. Point where lines met midline was used as origin for measurements. Point where they would have met was used (not where they actually met) in making craniotomies.

Z coordinate at sight of craniotomy:
* Left side: -0.71mm
* Right side: -0.67mm

== Details ==

=== Purpose ===
This animal was trained and implanted on the right side auditory striatum. The purpose was collect data from an awake, behaving mouse. We analyzed data from the animal doing the psychometric curve and reward change task.

=== Superglue as first layer ===
As with the last few animals, superglue was used as a first layer on the skull. This has proven to be very successful.

=== Electrolytic Lesions ===
Before, euthanizing this animal, electrolytic lesions were made. The polarity was switched so that the ground of the 12V DC source was touching the gold pins in the implant and the power was in the mouth of the mouse. The ground was just touched to the gold pins very quickly. The animal was still seen to jump. See electrolytic lesion section below to see lesion images.

=== Skull screws to hold implant ===
Three screws of size #000-120 were put into the skull. Two screws were in the front (anterior) of the skull in front of bregma (one on each side of bregma) and one on the opposite side of the implant. The holes were made first by hand drill using a 0.028" diameter drill bit. Drilling the holes caused a little bit of blood to come out. The screws were later covered with dental acrylic to securely attach the implant to the skull.

=== Tetrode DiI coating ===
The tetrodes were coated with DiI so that when the brain slices are imaged, where the tetrodes were inserted could clearly be seen. These can be seen in the images labelled overlay in the brain slice images. They are useful in determining whether the target was reached and if the coordinates to get to the auditory striatum were correct or not. However, the area of the brain with the tetrodes was somewhat destroyed so the tetrode location is very unclear.

=== Ground wire ===
Stainless steel (0.005" bare, 0.008" coated, annealed) was used for ground wire. A 1mm hook was made and placed under the skull after a small craniotomy. The ground wire craniotomy was made on the same side of the midline from where the implant is.

=== Sound Response ===
Sound response and frequency tuning was found in this mouse. The tetrodes were probably in the striatum but that cannot be confirmed by looking at the histology.

== Tetrode Lengths ==
The tetrodes were cut at an angle so that not all were the same length. The longest tetrode was inserted 2mm into the brain. The lengths listed below are lengths from the longest tetrode. (These are according to the names of the tetrodes on open-ephys NOT the EIB)
* TT5: 0um
* TT7: 110um
* TT6: 240um
* TT2: 260um
* TT8: 320um
* TT4: 340um
* TT3: 540um
* TT1: 1260um (This tetrode was way way shorter than the rest for some reason.

The tetrode impedances seemed to be in the normal range of 100-400kOhms when tested except for TT4 #3 and #4 were 66.0kOhms and 65.5kOhms respectively.

== Tetrode advance ==
* starting depth of tetrodes in brain: 2.0 mm from surface
* 1 turn is 317 micrometers
* For screw positions, up (^) is the anterior of the brain

=== Training Results ===
Adap015 was doing the psychometric curve and reward change task. He was doing it fairly well but at around 2016-03-06 (while Billy was away and the mouse was being trained downstairs) adap015 started to do poorly. This was when it was found that the reward change task that I had left him on while I was away had a bug. The reward task would freeze after 400 trials. Adap015 started to do poorly on his psychometric curve in the reward change task after two days with this error. When the bug was fixed, the psychometric curve never recovered.

== Accuracy of implant==
Distance to the farthest posterior end of the right auditory striatum: UNKOWN

The tetrodes were coated with DiI before being inserted into the brain. The images shown were taken as an overlay to show the DiI and where the tetrodes were in the brain. For this mouse, the tetrodes were inserted 2.0mm deep then moved down. The depth or location in brain cannot be confirmed from the images since the area of the brain where the tetrodes were was destroyed. It is not certain what destroyed this part of the brain. The mouse was old when implanting so it may have been age. Furthermore, the mouse started being unable to do the psychometric curve well so age is a likely possibility. It could have been movement of the tetrodes or how they were removed from the brain. Maybe the perfusion did not work that well and while the tetrodes were being screwed back up, the brain was ripped up. Another possibility is that the brain sat too long in PFA after brain extraction. It was in PFA for about 5 days. However, the rest of the brain was unaffected. The tetrodes found a little auditory response and frequency tuning in this location.

== Electrolytic Lesion ==
Only 2 tetrodes were used to make electrolytic lesions in the brain. Tetrodes 1 and 5 were used since they were the shortest and longest length tetrodes. Two lesions cannot be seen. The area of the brain where the lesions would be is too destroyed.
