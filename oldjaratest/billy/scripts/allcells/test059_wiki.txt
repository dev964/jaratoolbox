== Animal information ==
* '''DOB''': 2014-03-18
* '''Strain''': C57BL/6J
* '''Experimenter''': Billy
* '''Study''': Tetrode recordings from auditory striatum during switching task

== Procedures ==
* 2015-05-31: Billy implanted 8 tetrodes coated in DiI to target right auditory striatum.
** A-P: -1.7mm from Bregma
** M-L: 3.5mm right
** D-V: -2.0mm from brain surface on day of surgery
* 2015-08-11: Perfused and brain extracted

== Skull measurements ==
From Bregma (where sutures meet) to Lambda:
* X: 0.00mm left
* Y: -3.64mm back
* Z: -0.07mm up

From where Bregma lines meet to where they would have met: 0.47mm

From where Lambda lines meet to where they would have met: 0mm

Notes: Bregma lines come in and dip low before meeting together. Point where lines met midline was used as origin for measurements. Point where they would have met was used (not where they actually met) in making craniotomies.

Z coordinate at sight of craniotomy:
* Left side: -0.46mm
* right side: -0.53mm

== Details ==

=== Purpose ===
This animal was trained and implanted on the right side auditory striatum. The purpose was collect data from an awake, behaving mouse. We analyzed data from the animal doing the switching task.

=== Going Deaf ===
This animal we presume went deaf. He was very old when implanted. Then he was doing the switching task well but seemingly overnight, he couldn't do the switching task. We switched him to the psychometric curve and he couldn't perform. He even did the simple two frequency discrimination task and couldn't get it (he was guessing every time). He was implanted at 14 months old and went deaf at 16 months old.

=== Superglue as first layer ===
As with the last few animals, superglue was used as a first layer on the skull. This has proven to be very successful.

=== Electrolytic Lesions ===
Before, euthanizing this animal, electrolytic lesions were made. The polarity was switched so that the ground of the 12V DC source was touching the gold pins in the implant and the power was in the mouth of the mouse. The ground was just touched to the gold pins very quickly. The animal was still seen to jump. See electrolytic lesion section below to see lesion images.

=== Skull screws to hold implant ===
Three screws of size #000-120 were put into the skull. Two screws were in the front (anterior) of the skull in front of bregma (one on each side of bregma) and one on the opposite side of the implant. The holes were made first by hand drill using a 0.028" diameter drill bit. Drilling the holes caused a little bit of blood to come out. The screws were later covered with dental acrylic to securely attach the implant to the skull.

=== Tetrode DiI coating ===
The tetrodes were coated with DiI so that when the brain slices are imaged, where the tetrodes were inserted could clearly be seen. These can be seen in the images labelled overlay in the brain slice images. They are useful in determining whether the target was reached and if the coordinates to get to the auditory striatum were correct or not.

=== Ground wire ===
Stainless steel (0.005" bare, 0.008" coated, annealed) was used for ground wire. A 1mm hook was made and placed under the skull after a small craniotomy. The ground wire craniotomy was made on the same side of the midline from where the implant is.

== Tetrode Lengths ==
The tetrodes were cut at an angle so that not all were the same length. The longest tetrode was inserted 2mm into the brain. The lengths listed below are lengths from the longest tetrode. (These are according to the names of the tetrodes on open-ephys NOT the EIB)
* TT8: 0um
* TT1: 100um
* TT5: 190um
* TT7: 280um
* TT2: 510um
* TT3,TT4: 610um
* TT6: 930um


The tetrode impedences seemed to be in the normal range of 100-400kOhms when tested except for TT6. TT6 electrodes #3 and #4 have 0.55kOhm and ).46kOhm impedance. They may be shorted to Gnd.

== Tetrode advance ==
* starting depth of tetrodes in brain: 2.0 mm from surface
* 1 turn is 317 micrometers
* For screw positions, up (^) is the anterior of the brain

=== Training Results ===
The mouse did well on the switching task between 6k and 19kHz. However, he was very old when implanted and went deaf. He was unable to do the switching task and when we switched to use the psychometric curve, he could not perform either (the line was flat). Even on the simple two frequency discrimination task he seemed to be guessing. Therefore, we suspect he went deaf.

== Accuracy of implant==
Distance to start of right auditory striatum: 300um anterior

The tetrodes were found to be in the correct area

These images show red DiI where the the end of the tetrodes were and therefore one can estimate how accurate the coordinates for the craniotomy to get to the auditory striatum were. The tetrodes were coated with DiI before being inserted into the brain. The images shown were taken as an overlay to show the DiI and where the tetrodes were in the brain. For this mouse, the tetrodes were inserted 2.0mm deep then moved down. The tetrodes seem to be at the desired target in the auditory striatum. The tetrodes found very good auditory response and frequency tuning in this location.

== Electrolytic Lesion ==
Only 2 tetrodes were used to make electrolytic lesions in the brain. Tetrodes 6 and 8 were used since they were the shortest and longest length tetrodes. Two lesions can clearly be seen. They look like dark circles on the bottom of the right striatum. The first slice, C5, shows a small hole where the lesion is.
