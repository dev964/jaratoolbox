== Animal information ==
* '''DOB''': 2014-10-05
* '''Strain''': C57BL/6J
* '''Experimenter''': Billy
* '''Study''': Tetrode recordings from auditory striatum during switching task

== Procedures ==
* 2015-05-31: Billy implanted 8 tetrodes coated in DiI to target right auditory striatum.
** A-P: -1.7mm from Bregma
** M-L: 3.5mm right
** D-V: -2.0mm from brain surface on day of surgery
* 2016-02-17: Euthanized and perfused.

== Skull measurements ==
From Bregma (where sutures meet) to Lambda:
* X: 0.00mm left
* Y: -3.42mm back
* Z: -0.00mm down

From where Bregma lines meet to where they would have met: 0.64mm up (0.13mm to the right)

From where Lambda lines meet to where they would have met: 0mm

Notes: Bregma lines come in and dip low before meeting together. Point where lines met midline was used as origin for measurements. Point where they would have met was used (not where they actually met) in making craniotomies.

Z coordinate at sight of craniotomy:
* Left side: -0.54mm
* Right side: -0.54mm

== Details ==

=== Purpose ===
This animal was trained and implanted on the right side auditory striatum. The purpose was collect data from an awake, behaving mouse. We analyzed data from the animal doing the switching task.

=== Superglue as first layer ===
As with the last few animals, superglue was used as a first layer on the skull. This has proven to be very successful.

=== Electrolytic Lesions ===
Before, euthanizing this animal, electrolytic lesions were made. The polarity was switched so that the ground of the 12V DC source was touching the gold pins in the implant and the power was in the mouth of the mouse. The ground was just touched to the gold pins very quickly. The animal was still seen to jump. See electrolytic lesion section below to see lesion images.

=== Skull screws to hold implant ===
Three screws of size #000-120 were put into the skull. Two screws were in the front (anterior) of the skull in front of bregma (one on each side of bregma) and one on the opposite side of the implant. The holes were made first by hand drill using a 0.028" diameter drill bit. Drilling the holes caused a little bit of blood to come out. The screws were later covered with dental acrylic to securely attach the implant to the skull.

=== Tetrode DiI coating ===
The tetrodes were coated with DiI so that when the brain slices are imaged, where the tetrodes were inserted could clearly be seen. These can be seen in the images labelled overlay in the brain slice images. They are useful in determining whether the target was reached and if the coordinates to get to the auditory striatum were correct or not.

=== Ground wire ===
Stainless steel (0.005" bare, 0.008" coated, annealed) was used for ground wire. A 1mm hook was made and placed under the skull after a small craniotomy. The ground wire craniotomy was made on the same side of the midline from where the implant is.

=== Sound Response ===
Sound response and frequency tuning was found in this mouse. The tetrodes seem to be in the striatum and moved all the way through.

== Tetrode Lengths ==
The tetrodes were cut at an angle so that not all were the same length. The longest tetrode was inserted 2mm into the brain. The lengths listed below are lengths from the longest tetrode. (These are according to the names of the tetrodes on open-ephys NOT the EIB)
* TT7,TT8: 0um
* TT1: 110um
* TT5: 230um
* TT2: 310um
* TT6: 430um
* TT3: 460um
* TT4: 570um


The tetrode impedences seemed to be in the normal range of 100-400kOhms when tested.

== Tetrode advance ==
* starting depth of tetrodes in brain: 2.0 mm from surface
* 1 turn is 317 micrometers
* For screw positions, up (^) is the anterior of the brain

=== Training Results ===

Test089 was very good at switching at first and did many trials. However, he was very old (a year and a half when he died) and therefore had very poor performance near the end. He often would start on the high block and do very well, then switch to the low block well, and then not be able to switch back to the high block. Curiously, after the winter break when he got free water for over a week, I was able to train him to switch well for a little while (maybe a week or so). He did switching well and started to have the same issue of not being able switch back to the high block.

One large issue with test089 was that he did a lot of invalid trials (60% or so). This I believe affected his performance because he did not know when the block had switched. He'd often start to do a lot of invalid trials at the switch of a block and do very poorly on a block. Maybe he got impatient when he got an error and started to poke faster. His delay before target had to be changed to 0.13 +- 0.02 sec. This helped for a bit but then he started to have the same issue even at these times.

== Accuracy of implant==

Distance to the end of the right auditory striatum: 700um anterior

These images show red DiI where the the end of the tetrodes were and therefore one can estimate how accurate the coordinates for the craniotomy to get to the auditory striatum were. The tetrodes were coated with DiI before being inserted into the brain. The images shown were taken as an overlay to show the DiI and where the tetrodes were in the brain. For this mouse, the tetrodes were inserted 2.0mm deep then moved down. The tetrodes seem to be approximately 700um too anterior to the desired target in the auditory striatum. The depth of the tetrodes at the time of lesioning was too deep. The tetrodes found good auditory response and frequency tuning in this location.

== Electrolytic Lesion ==

Only 3 tetrodes were used to make electrolytic lesions in the brain. Tetrodes 4, 7, and 8 were used since they were the two longest and shortest tetrodes. One large lesion can clearly be seen. However, which is which lesion is unknown.
